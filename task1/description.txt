In the images folder you can find jpg files which are 
photographs of a mouse in a three-chambered cage taken once
per second.

Write a program which automatically locates the mouse on 
each frame and returns the time spent in each of three
compartments. 

Notes:
1. Make sure your program would work for white mice.
2. Your program does not have to find the boundaries
of the compartments, you can provide it as an extra input.
