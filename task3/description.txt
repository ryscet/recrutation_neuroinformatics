In the imgdata folder there are CSV files containing 
experimental data. 
Each file contains results of analysis of one brain image.
The files start like this:

Animal number,912
Age,23
Picture number,1
No,Size,Intensity
1,2.046348,172.567250
2,2.160691,220.771969
3,2.146303,268.172057

In the header you can find the ID of the animal (Animal number), 
age of the animal in weeks, and consecutive number of the picture
for that animal. 
Below there is a list of cells identified at this image. 
Each cell is characterized by its size and intensity. 
The hypothesis is that the average size and intensity correlate 
with the age of the animal.
Write a program to verify this hypothesis. The output of the 
program should be plots of size and intensity (average of all
cells from each animal separately) as functions of age. 


Note: do not assume any specific number of animals / pictures 
in the imgdata folder. You may assume these number are <10000.
