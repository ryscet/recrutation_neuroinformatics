A group of mice lives in a house with four rooms (1, 2, 3, 4).
Mice are identified by their numbers (e.g. '0065-0136670531').
The whole experiment lasts 3 days, and is divided into six 
12-hour long phases (named PHASE 1 dark, PHASE 1 light, PHASE 2 dark, 
... PHASE 3 light).

In the script example.py you can find a stub of a data analysis program,
showing how to load and access the data. 

Write a program which:
1. calculates how much time each of the mice spent in each of the 
rooms in each experimental phase,
2. calculates how much time each *pair* of mice spent together (in 
the same room) in each experimental phase,
3. saves the results to an easily readable text or CSV file.
